### You can `CreateDuanji` to share funny things so that punsters who following you will see it as soon as possible. This operation creates a new `Duanji`, which is a standard NFT on Flow.

## Advanced
### Funny Index
* `Funny index` is used to describe how funny a `Duanji` is, which is calculated according to the count of commends the `Duanji` got and the time the `Duanji` was created.
* `Funny index` is also used to describe how funny a punster is. A punster's funny index depends on the sum of all his `Duanji`s' funny index.

### Advertising 
* You can publish an advertisement and punsters who following you will see it immediately. There will be a `Cooling time` for publishing advertisements, that is, you cannot publish again until the `cooling time` ends

### `Duanji` transfering
* The funny things can be *assetization*, that is, as `Duanji` is a standard NFT on Flow, it can be traded. The reality value is supported by the content of the funny thing, and also be supported by the commends it gets, which will make the `cooling time` of advertising of a punster shorter.
